# LAB - 02

## About Me

I am building out this website to serve as an 'About Me' for my Code Fellows Class 201 - Lab 02. It will contain instances of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website was built with VS Code text editor.

### Reflections and Comments and Collaborators

* Collaborators - My accountability partners Lorenzo Ortega and Shelby Harner!
* This lab was tricky getting the CSS to work with the reset CSS linked as well.
* Reflection - not a big fan of loops and if statements at the moment!
* During lab 04 Max was the driver while I navigated him to move my prompt questions into functions
